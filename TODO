BUGS

IMPROVEMENTS

- Pagination/infinite scroll.

FEATURES

- Show something on the homepage instead of a lot of whitespace. 3 random cards or suggested searches or the help text or recent searches or a featured card or anything really! Also when searches yield no results.
- I added a middle param to Search->where so we can see "!" as well as ":" and apply a NOT but I haven't done it yet. text!secret.
- Support searching for "can be used by class X" (different from class because includes neutral)
- Allow query/use in all languages supported not just en_US (API supports this with different URL for json).
- An "Advanced Search" form that lets you do it the crappy way.
- Generate examples automatically by spidering db and generating some likely searches (!)
- Mouseover behavior that mimics the game in list view
- Static explanatory text that mimics the game in detail view
- Show how much dust you get/need for each version of a card (based on rarity and whether it can be crafted?)
- Do something with card_mechanic and mechanic tables.
- Do something with card_play_requirement and play_requirement tables. (See https://github.com/HearthSim/hs-data/blob/master/PlayErrors.xml)
- Deck stats for found cards
- Deck lists for found cards
- Similar cards
- Comments on cards
- Link to the wiki from basically every keyword.
- Nice js mouseovers with bootstrap for basically every keyword.
- Smaller image option.
- Ordering options.
- Output options.

MINOR BUGS

- Can't search for totems?
- If you search for type:hero_power then (a) it's gross you have to include an underscore and (b) you won't see anything unless you also say no collectible and (c) this is currently broken even if you do this.
- http://wow.zamimg.com/images/hearthstone/cards/enus/original/CS2_041e.png is a blank image.
- It's a bit silly that attribute keys (and other keys) must be listed longest-first to prevent a shorter string "stealing" another. Just don't match unless we match the whole thing + an operator + a value. Backtracking?

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

- Support rarity null whatever that means (basic? no rarity?)
- Better explanation of why your search found nothing. "spelldmg>0" should not just say "0 cards".
- Log every search and num results if anyone ever uses it so we can see what they thought should work that did not.
- ordering should be
class(druid,hunter,mage,paladin,priest,rogue,shaman,warlock,warrior,neutral)
cmc
alphabetical
- Add alt and other attributes to the imgs.
- The way we are doing sets is messy and bad. They should probably have their own table and ids and then another table of alternative names.
- Find a better way to clean data (and reset auto_increment) in Loader.
- Search term in <title>. Card name in <title>.
- Default to f:standard and make them say wild if they want it
- Mirror on github by adding as a remote
- Optionally always instead/as well show golden (premium) version
- is hearthstoneapi.com just better/the same as hearthstonejson.com? Has image urls?
- config.json should use "database.name" and convert to databaseName() on Config.
- Use a namespace.
- Search when it uses the WHERE clause generated in the top level SQL should use PDO placeholder but that doesn't seem to work for some reason so is using concatenation
- Search query generation uses a lot of concatenation. Can it instead use PDO somehow? We can then not need Database->quote.
- Support is:weapon is:collectible isnt:weapon isnt:collectible?
- Pagination
= debug=1 should also breakdown how the search was parsed. ("s:og")

MINOR FEATURES

- Search for totems
- Search for secrets
- When a card would summon a random 3 cost beast or whatever link to a search for all of them (note: different if standard or wild).
- More ORDER BY options. Default could be cost?
