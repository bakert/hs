BUGS

- http://wow.zamimg.com/images/hearthstone/cards/enus/original/CS2_041e.png is a blank image.
- It's a bit silly that attribute keys (and other keys) must be listed longest-first to prevent a shorter string "stealing" another. Just don't match unless we match the whole thing + an operator + a value. Backtracking?
- Searching for a text field replaces spaces with underscores but that's not how artists are stored, are they? should be double quoted.
- Strictly speaking `if (!parts[i].startsWith(k)) {` should be looking for k + a valid operator but does not.

IMPROVEMENTS

- All of the queries to set up the advanced search UI only need to be run once not every time the page is loaded.
- debug=1 should also breakdown how the search was parsed. ("s:og")
- Support > and < style operators in rarity search. Probably by making rarity an int foreign key into another table.
- Support in-hs style searching on numeric values like cost:3- and cost:1-4 as per http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/blog/20056284/search-your-hearthstone-collection-like-never-before-3-17-2016 (maybe INSTEAD of > <, etc.)
- Skycap'n Kragg has Charrrrrge not Charge although they do the same thing. But search on text won't find it. Need "m:charge" or similar? card_mechanic table has him as having CHARGE.
- Pagination/infinite scroll.
- Better explanation of why your search found nothing. "spelldmg>0" should not just say "0 cards".
- Log every search and num results if anyone ever uses it so we can see what they thought should work that did not.
- Default to f:standard and make them say wild if they want it
- Optionally always instead/as well show golden (premium) version
- Support is:weapon is:collectible isnt:weapon isnt:collectible?
- JS could be written from PHP to keep operators regex in sync with Operator.
- The js UI could input short-form versions of the keys to hint to the user that they can use short form keys.
- Hardcoded sets in advanced search UI could be replaced by a query if we had a table that gave us the ordering and preferred names of sets.

FEATURES

- Mouseover behavior that mimics the game in list view
- Static explanatory text that mimics the game in detail view
- Ordering options. (order:cost,name)
- Output options.
- Smaller image option. (http://wow.zamimg.com/images/hearthstone/cards/enus/medium/EX1_116.png) (images:small, image:large, img:medium)
- Nice js mouseovers with bootstrap for basically every keyword.
- Link to the wiki from basically every keyword.
- Similar cards. There's a start to this in similar.php. Might need to be run as part of loader and stored if it's slow.
- Deck stats for found cards
- Deck lists for found cards
- Do something with card_mechanic and mechanic tables. Does this open up much other than making Skycap'n Kragg searchable? text:"<mechanic name>" finds you things that care about the mechanic as well I suppose whereas m:charge or m:secret would find you things with that keyword only. Is replacing _ with " " good enough for search?
- Show how much dust you get/need for each version of a card (based on rarity and whether it can be crafted?)
- Generate examples automatically by spidering db and generating some likely searches (!)
- Allow query/use in all languages supported not just en_US (API supports this with different URL for json).
- I added a middle param to Search->where so we can see "!" as well as ":" and apply a NOT but I haven't done it yet. text!secret.
- Show something on the homepage instead of a lot of whitespace. 3 random cards or suggested searches or the help text or recent searches or a featured card or anything really! Also when searches yield no results.
- Search for totems
- Search for secrets
- When a card would summon a random 3 cost beast or whatever link to a search for all of them (note: different if standard or wild).
- More ORDER BY options. Default could be cost?
- Do something with card_play_requirement and play_requirement tables. (See https://github.com/HearthSim/hs-data/blob/master/PlayErrors.xml)
- Comments on cards
- Arena tier ranking from http://www.heartharena.com/tierlist
